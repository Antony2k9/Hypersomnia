From here you can go to:
- Encyclopaedia of the [Hypersomnia universe](universe).
- Documentation of the [Hypersomnia source code](docs).
- [Content creation guides](content_guides) for the Hypersomnia editor.

Whether a player or developer, you probably want to launch Hypersomnia first.  
Unfortunately, no binaries are available yet.  
Up-to-date instructions for how to install the game are always found in the [README here](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia#how-to-build).

Remember that you can suggest changes to each page by creating an [issue](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia/issues) or a pull request.
