# Initial scene state

- What do we put there initially?
	- The minimal setup that suppresses all errors
- Choose a template
	- Bomb defusal map
- Or just... supported modes
	- Bomb defusal map
	- Pick at least one
- Default mode
	- Don't pick the preffix based on that because we might still use tdm_ OR fy_ for a deathmatch map (or even fy for a bomb defusal map)
	- Perhaps too much noise in initial creation gui, let's specify that later, because a ruleset will also be chosen by default
- Depending on the supported modes, different stuff might be put there initially
- Right, also depending on the supported modes, many more stuff will be needed to suppress errors
