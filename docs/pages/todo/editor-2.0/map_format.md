- Map version considerations
	- Communiy map migration
		- copy user folder to OLD_HYPERSOMNIA, in case there are some important maps too
		- Solution for map conversions: just keep binary versions in caches?

	- Check official map version upon connection
		- if mismatch
			- custom? re-download
			- official? disconnect
