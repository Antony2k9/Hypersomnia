- We could bind C to silently swap weapon between hands?

- We should lock in the trajectory for the thrown grenade/knife the moment we press the hotkey for it
	- Otherwise it's unusable

- For bilmer and covert, shot bullet traces only briefly

- Pistols could just have a slower rate of fire and they'll be perfectly balanced
	- Otherwise they're just superior smgs honestly

- Once we add scopes we could consider adding a visible laser?
	- So that someone could have a chance to react to being shot from an off-screen distance

- Later we'll balance the rattle/spear by increasing the throw distance
	- This will break the ABI though

- Also it's critical to lengthen the hand for pistol

- USP
	- RoF: 160-170

- Possible balancing for revolver: longer loading time? Perhaps even longer than deagle
	- Because it's really OP with its burst fire mode
	- 1200 -> 1500. At least as long as the scout.

- Calico longer to reload than bulwark?
	- 1500 -> 1200
	- Or just the same

- Akimbo sn69 are really op, they're better than an SMG
- balance kek9 against sn69?
	- Maybe a little more damage, to the point that it just takes one less hit with armor but takes same amount of hits without armor

## Done

- A hpsr hidden in inventory could stop emitting particles
	- It's already very hard to play it so we should do at least that

- Buff AWP (HPSR)
	- Nobody plays it in competitive environments right now
	- Remove the particles giving off the location, that makes it literally pointless
		- Let's leave it only for the launcher
	- Make it a bit lighter
	- Dmg: 198
	- Price can stay the same
	- We need people to fear the awp


- Zamiec/pro90 need a buff because they're never used
	- less recoil probably to both
	- more muzzle velocity for zamiec
		- nah, let's keep them CQB
	- more ammo for cyberspray
