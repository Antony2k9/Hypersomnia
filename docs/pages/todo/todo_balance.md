summary: Balancing issues to be solved.

- A hpsr hidden in inventory could stop emitting particles
	- It's already very hard to play it so we should do at least that

- Once we add scopes we could consider adding a visible laser?
	- So that someone could have a chance to react to being shot from an off-screen distance

- Later we'll balance the rattle/spear by increasing the throw distance
	- This will break the ABI though

- Also it's critical to lengthen the hand for pistol

- USP
	- RoF: 160-170

- Possible balancing for revolver: longer loading time? Perhaps even longer than deagle
	- Because it's really OP with its burst fire mode
	- 1200 -> 1500. At least as long as the scout.

- Calico longer to reload than bulwark?
	- 1500 -> 1200
	- Or just the same

- Akimbo sn69 are really op, they're better than an SMG
- balance kek9 against sn69?
	- Maybe a little more damage, to the point that it just takes one less hit with armor but takes same amount of hits without armor
