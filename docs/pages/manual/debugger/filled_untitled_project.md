You have just filled the project with a test scene.
The screen might remain blank for a moment while the game regenerates resources like neon maps.

It is highly recommended that you now save this untitled project to a reasonable location.

Prepare an empty folder somewhere on your disk,
and name it exactly how you want to name your project.
Your project's name will be EQUIVALENT to the folder's name.  

To save, simply tap Ctrl+S (File->Save).
Alternatively, press F12 (File->Save as).

An OS-specific folder selection dialog should pop up.
When you confirm your selection, the folder will be populated with a bunch of project files. 

The editor is still highly experimental, so remember to save your work often!
