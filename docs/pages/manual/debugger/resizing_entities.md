You are now resizing the selected entities with your mouse.
To confirm the operation, press Enter or Left Mouse Button.
To cancel the transformation without making any changes, press ESC.

By default, the bounding box of all resized objects will be snapped to the grid.
Support for resizing of multiple entities is still experimental,
so for now, you should resize only one entity at a time.

The currently resized edge(s) will be indicated with a red, dashed line.

You may notice that some entities will stretch while resizing,
while others will simply repeat the sprite (tile) across the entire excess size.
This behaviour is configurable per-entity.
Go to Sprite invariant of the selected entity and tick or untick the Tile excess size flag.
For example, this flag will be on for tiled floors and walls,
and it will be off for entities you want to stretch instead of tiling.
