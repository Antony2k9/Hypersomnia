The Common state dialog lets you edit properties that are not tied to any particular entity or flavour, 
but are still required by the game logic.

Simply put, these are some global parameters for the game world.

Similarly to flavour properties, the common state properties NEVER change during gameplay - 
except when the map designer tweaks values during a playtest - 
and can only ever be modified from within this editor.

## Example settings to be tweaked here

- Parameters of all spells and perks.
- Appearance and descriptions of the hp, pe and cp bars.
- Ambient light color.
- Epsilon values for complex numerical algorithms, like visibility or pathfinding.
- Effect definitions for events that are not tied to any particular flavour, like:
	- the impact sound of hitting a Personal Electricity shield,
	- the sound of an item being picked up.
