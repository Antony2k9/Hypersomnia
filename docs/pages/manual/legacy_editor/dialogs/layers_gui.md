The "Layers" window lets you temporarily show and hide chosen layers of entities.

There are two columns of checkboxes.

"S" stands for "Selectable".
Unchecking within this column will make the entities in this layer 
unselectable, but still visible.

"V" stands for "Visible".
Unchecking within this column will make the entities in this layer 
both invisible and unselectable.

A common use case is to temporarily hide floors or other big objects
that highlight the whole screen due to constantly being hovered.

## Keyboard bindings

- Press H to temporarily hide the layers of all selected entities.
	- This is very useful if you want to select an entity that is below several other layers 
	  of unrelated stuff. A good example is if you want to select a sand dune
	  that is possibly below several fish, a water overlay entity, water caustics entities,
	  and maybe under some flowers at that.
- Press U to unhide all layers.
