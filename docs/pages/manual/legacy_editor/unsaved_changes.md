You have just performed some operation, 
or navigated the history of changes away from the last saved revision.
Thus, you have some unsaved changes.
At the right-bottom of the screen, you should see the description of what you have just done.

Whenever you have unsaved changes, an asterisk character ("*") will appear next to the tab's name.
Editor won't let you close the tab as long as the asterisk remains there. 

To make the asterisk disappear, you can:
- Just save the current revision with Ctrl+S (File->Save) or F12 (File->Save As), or...
- ...go back to the revision that was last saved to hard drive.
	- To do this, you can undo (Ctrl+Z), redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z), or...
	- ...navigate the History window (Alt+H) manually.
		- The revision that is currently saved to hard drive will be highlighted in green.

Save your work to continue learning about the editor.
It is a good habit to save your work often.
